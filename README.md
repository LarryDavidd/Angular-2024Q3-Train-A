## General

Welcome to our Train-A app.

The main purpose of our application is to provide users with the ability to search and purchase a ticket for a railroad trip. Our application provides a user-friendly interface to make it as comfortable as possible for the user to make purchases.

The application also provides an admin panel. Here you can create and edit stations, types of wagons, routes and route schedules.

An important aspect of our app is that it is responsive so that it looks great on various devices with a minimum resolution of 390 pixels.Â This feature makes shopping enjoyable, no matter which device the user prefers.
